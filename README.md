 # JavaScript Functions Assignment
This project involves writing several JavaScript functions to manipulate strings, arrays, and perform basic mathematical operations. Below are the tasks you'll need to complete, along with the specifications for each function.

# Instructions
1. String Manipulation Functions
Reverse a String
Write a function that reverses a given string.


# Capitalize Words
Implement a function that capitalizes the first letter of each word in a sentence.

# 2. Array Functions
Find Maximum and Minimum
Write functions to find the maximum and minimum values in an array of numbers.


# 3. Mathematical Functions
Factorial
Write a function to calculate the factorial of a given number.


# How to Run the Code
Copy the functions provided above into a JavaScript file (functions.js).
To test the functions, you can call them with different inputs
You can use the browser's developer console or Node.js to run the script. To run it with Node.js, use the command:
bash

# Conclusion
These functions cover a variety of basic concepts in JavaScript including string manipulation, array operations, and mathematical logic. Make sure to test all functions and verify that they return the expected results.
